            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A woeful ſtory I'll to you relate,</l>
               <l>Of a poor Widow's ſad and diſmal fate:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her Husband dead, ſhe in great want did fall,</l>
               <l>And little had to keep herſelf withal;</l>
               <l>Seven Babes, poor Soul, ſhe had to keep beſide,</l>
               <l>And knew not how ſhe ſhould for them provide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She diligently labour'd night and day,</l>
               <l>Her Charge to keep, and ſome ſmall depts to pay;</l>
               <l>And oftentimes for bread her goods did pawn,</l>
               <l>Till at the laſt, poor Creature, all was gone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her Children dear to her did cry for bread,</l>
               <l>Who nothing had to put into her head;</l>
               <l>And as her Children for relief did cry,</l>
               <l>She ſent up prayers unto the God on high:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O God, quoth ſhe, moſt righteous, good and juſt,</l>
               <l>Regard my cry, that in thee put my truſt,</l>
               <l>Look down on me with a moſt gracious eye,</l>
               <l>That now with want am ready for to die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thou to Elias gratious wer't indeed,</l>
               <l>And in his want ſent ravens him to feed;</l>
               <l>Take pitty then upon my Children ſmall,</l>
               <l>And ſend me food to feed them there withal.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>We in the ſcriptures oftentimes do read,</l>
               <l>How with five loaves thou didſt five thouſand feed,</l>
               <l>And when of hunger they were quite bereft,</l>
               <l>Of ſcraps and fragments were twelve baskets left.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I know, quoth ſhe, thy power is ſtill the ſame,</l>
               <l>And ſtill will call upon thy mighty name,</l>
               <l>In hopes that thou at laſt will prove my Friend,</l>
               <l>And so, poor Soul, ſhe did her prayers end.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh Mother dear, her Children then did ſay,</l>
               <l>Give us ſome bread, we have had none to day;</l>
               <l>I am half ſtarv'd ſays one, and I ſaid t'other,</l>
               <l>Thus did they cry unto their careful Mother.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She hearing this, unto her Children ſaid,</l>
               <l>At night, my Babes, you ſhall be fill'd with bread;</l>
               <l>And with theſe words ſhe did her Babes content,</l>
               <l>So ſhe, poor Wretch, unto the market went.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her very coat ſhe from her back did ſell</l>
               <l>For five poor ſhillings, as is known full well;</l>
               <l>But mark how this poor Soul was ſtrangely croſt,</l>
               <l>Her purſe was cut, and all her mony loſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which being miſt, ſhe cry'd and made great moan,</l>
               <l>And to the Paſſengers ſhe made it known,</l>
               <l>Who little minded her ſo fill'd with grief,</l>
               <l>And nothing would allow to her relief.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Vnto her Husband's Brother then ſhe went,</l>
               <l>And her condition there did much lament,</l>
               <l>Deſiring him to truſt her, and did ſay,</l>
               <l>That ſhe would pay him the next market-day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Of this her expectation ſhe did fail,</l>
               <l>For prayers nor tears with him would then prevail,</l>
               <l>He ſaid that he had but ſmall ſtore of grain,</l>
               <l>Which would not ſerve till corn did come again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This dogged anſwer cut her to the heart,</l>
